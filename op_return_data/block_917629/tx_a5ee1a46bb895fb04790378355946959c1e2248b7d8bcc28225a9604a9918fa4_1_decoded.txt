We've finally got the ultimate Leo's birth certificate with our name as parents and the new Leo's last name. We already enter to get state documentation as well as passport. 2 weeks ago we've got a healthy situation with Leo, he had fever and a seizure. We've had to rush him to ER. That was a bit scary, but he recovered 100%. We love you, Leo!
