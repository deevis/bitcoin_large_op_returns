Better safe than sorry! An attorney advised me to post this. The violation of property rights can be punished by law.  NOTE: All nodes must post an OP_RETURN like this. If you do not publish an OP_RETURN, at least once, it will be technically understood that you are allowing the use of your hard drive for the storage of arbitrary data, generally recognized to be spam. 
I HEREBY STATE THAT I DO NOT GIVE MY PERMISSION TO USE ANY OF MY HARD DRIVE TO STORE SPAM.
