Trurl is my linux box at home (trurl and my other computers are described <a href="trurl.html">elsewhere</a>). Trurl runs Linux kernel version 2.1.7 on a i586/60. Here's a few links with linux content:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.linux.org/">linux.org</a> is a good palce to start...links to ftp sites, docs, newsletters, code, list archives, and commercial sites may be found within.

<a name="coding"><font size="6"><b>coding:</b></font></a>
I have coded in C, C++, perl, Tcl/Tk, Java, NewtonScript, x86 asm, and ARM 610 asm. C would have to be my favorite due to it's power without the overhead of classes and ability to write very compact (and sometimes obscure) code. I also enjoy writing at the low-level at which asm is found. I am currently delving into more Xlib programming. Here are some links I have found useful:

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.softguide.com/">softguide</a> contains links to software development products on the web. Links to libs, tools, etc...

<a name="scifi"><font size="6"><b>sci-fi:</b></font></a>
I have a tendency to inhale books, my shelves are teeming with paperbacks, and my bookstore charges are high. Some of my favorite authors and thier websites are listed below:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://world.std.com/~mmcirvin/vitrifax.html">Stanislaw Lem</a> - My computer's name was taken from Lem's "The Cyberiad." Trurl is a constructor robot who tries to out-invent his colleague Klaupicuis. A must sci-fi read.
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.infovillage.com/PatronSaints/Gibson.html">William Gibson</a> - Coiner of the word "cyberspace," he wrote "Neuromancer," "Idoru," and my favorite "White Light." He also wrote the short story and screenplay of "Johnny Mnemonic."
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.scifi.com/pulp/fw/stephenson/index.html">Neal Stephenson</a> - Wrote "The Diamond Age," dealing with nanotech, "Snow Crash," hackers, pizza delivery mafia, skateboard couriers, <b>the best</b> novel I've read in a long time...

<li>Nancy Kress - "Beggars In Spain" - <b>WOW!</b> This novel was great. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.scifi.com/mst3000">Mystery Science Theatre 3000</a> - When I watch TV, this is what I watch. Hilarious!!! I wish TCI would pick up the Sci-Fi channel.....

<a name="transit"><font size="6"><b>mass transportation:</b></font></a>
I don't own a car. I will never own a car. I have no need for one. I rely instead on three alternate forms of transit: mass transit, my bike, and walking. I hope to live in a technologically advanced major city, one with a mature transportation infrastructure. The only cities that come to mind currently are Toronto and Tokyo. Hmmm... Anyway, most of my transit links are on <a href="transit.html">this</a> page. Here are some others:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.bistate.com/">Bi-State</a> Development Agency - my local transit authority that is actively pursuing light-rail expansion. Our system, dubbed MetroLink, currently spans 18 miles from East St. Louis (Illinois), through downtown, and northwest to Lambert International. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.up.com/">Union Pacific</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.bnsf.com/">Burlington Northern-Santa Fe</a> are proposing commuter rail lines through St. Louis and perhaps even to Springfield (which indicates a stop in Rolla)!
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> - I have taken Amtrak from St. Louis to Chicago, Baltimore to Philly to New York, Seattle to Portland, and from San Diego to Los Angeles. I can't get enough!
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970618142416/http://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound Bus Lines</a> - My current link from St. Louis to Rolla and back. A bus will do until rail arrives.
