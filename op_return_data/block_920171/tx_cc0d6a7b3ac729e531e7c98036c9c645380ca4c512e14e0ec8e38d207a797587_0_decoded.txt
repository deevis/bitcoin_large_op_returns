{   "p":"void",   "op":"announce",   "whitepaper":"OP_VOID - Bitcoin Metaprotocol Whitepaper  1. Introduction  OP_VOID is a minimalist Bitcoin metaprotocol that operates entirely within OP_RETURN outputs. It enables structured data, ASCII art, or external references to exist natively on-chain, without relying on Ordinals, Inscriptions, or any UTXO-based indexing scheme.  Each OP_VOID transaction contains exactly two OP_RETURN outputs:  1. The first holds a JSON header defining the operation. 2. The second contains free-form data - text, ASCII, or a link to external media.  The design goal is simplicity, auditability, and independence from any external protocol layer.  ---  2. Core Definitions  Protocol identifier: "p": "void" Operations: announce, deploy, mint, transfer, burn Collection: a named group of related objects, created via `deploy` Object: a single minted item within a collection Owner: the address controlling the corresponding UTXO, as defined by the protocol logic Chain of ownership: the sequence of transactions from mint → transfer → burn  ---   3. General Rules  1. Each OP_VOID transaction must have exactly two OP_RETURN outputs:     [0] — JSON header (UTF-8, no BOM)    [1] — content or URL reference 2. A transaction may include up to two spendable outputs:     one for the recipient (to) or initiator (in case of mint),    one optional change output. 3. All JSON fields are UTF-8 strings. 4. All txid references use full 64-character hex encoding. 5. One transaction equals one action — one mint, one transfer, one burn. 6. Protocol logic is entirely deterministic and client-verifiable.    No off-chain state is required.  ---  4. Operation Formats  4.1 announce  Defines the initial publication of the protocol specification. The whitepaper field must contain the full protocol text.  {   "p":"void",   "op":"announce",   "whitepaper":"" }  OP_RETURN[1]: optional ASCII banner.   4.2 deploy  Creates a new collection.  {   "p":"void",   "op":"deploy",   "name":"GENESIS",   "supply":"10000",   "description":"Genesis void collection. Bitcoin is anything you want it to be, so is this collection. Image, video, music, poem - literally anything" }   The transaction txid becomes the collection identifier. supply may be an integer or the string "open". OP_RETURN[1] may contain a manifesto, preview, or external link.  ---  4.3 mint  Creates a single object inside an existing collection.  {   "p":"void",   "op":"mint",   "deploytx":"<txid_of_deploy>",   "collection":"GENESIS",   "amount":1 }  Rules:  deploytx is mandatory and must reference a valid deploy transaction. The initial owner is automatically the initiator (the sender of the transaction input). OP_RETURN[1] stores ASCII art, plain text, or a 'url:' to external data. Only 1 mint per tx  ---  4.4 transfer  Transfers ownership of an existing object.   {   "p":"void",   "op":"transfer",   "collection":"GENESIS",   "prev":"<txid_of_mint_or_last_transfer>",   "to":"bc1p..." }  Rules:  prev must reference the latest transaction of the object. The sender must be the current owner. OP_RETURN[1] is optional (e.g., comment or note).  ---  4.5 burn  Permanently destroys the object.  {   "p":"void",   "op":"burn",   "collection":"GENESIS",   "prev":"<txid_of_mint_or_transfer>" }  Rules:  * The transaction must contain no spendable outputs. * After confirmation, the object is permanently invalidated.  5. Indexer Verification Logic  1. announce — registers the base version and its whitepaper content. 2. deploy — stores the collection metadata: txid, name, supply, description. 3. mint     validates that deploytx exists and supply not exceeded;    creates an object record:             id = txid(mint)      collection = deploytx      owner = initiator address          links the second OP_RETURN as content. 4. transfer     verifies prev and current owner;    updates owner = to. 5. burn     verifies ownership;    ensures zero spendable outputs;    marks the object as burned. 6. Any invalid or malformed event (missing fields, wrong structure, broken link) is ignored.  6. Ownership Model Ownership is implicit, derived from transaction structure. mint: owner = initiator of the transaction (address of the spent UTXO). transfer: owner = to. burn: ownership ceases. Full history can be reconstructed by following prev references.  7. Technical Parameters  Encoding: UTF-8. Field order is not mandatory, but recommended:   p, op, deploytx, collection, amount, prev, to, name, supply, description, whitepaper. Aggregate OP_RETURN payload per transaction may reach up to 100 000 bytes (depending on node relay policy). Fully compatible with Bitcoin Core v30+, which allows multiple OP_RETURN outputs per transaction.   8. Security and Compatibility  OP_VOID relies solely on Bitcoin’s existing consensus rules.  Data stored in OP_RETURN is immutable and permanently visible on-chain. Off-chain indexers may optionally cache decoded data and links for efficient retrieval.  9. Governance and Evolution  The OP_VOID structure is immutable by design. Any modification to core mechanics must arise only through community consensus. The initial schema cannot be changed or deprecated — only additive extensions are permitted. New functions, operation types, or optional fields may be introduced provided they do not conflict with the existing base protocol.   10. Philosophy  OP_VOID is an experiment in purity - a protocol stripped of excess layers, existing fully within Bitcoin’s native transaction system. Its purpose is to move away from the conventional UTXO-based inscription format, minimizing blockchain clutter and bandwidth consumption. By embedding meaning directly inside OP_RETURN, OP_VOID removes the need for artificial UTXO creation and keeps the network cleaner.  It also stands as a statement against censorship and external gatekeeping: what enters the Bitcoin ledger cannot be silenced, reversed, or restricted. Once written into the chain, data becomes part of the collective permanence of the network itself.  In the void, meaning persists.  DYOR, NFA. Pure experiment for fun " }
