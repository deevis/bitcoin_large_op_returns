THE NEWEST WHY JACK DORSEY IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO

C++ for Bitcoin source code
Now confirmed Jack coded in C++ as far back as mid-90s

C in the White Paper
Now confirmed Jack coded in C as far back as mid-90s. 

Satoshi pseudonym
"Satoshi" was the first tweet Jack's best friend (Crystal Taylor) made on the beta version of Twitter in 2006 in reference to DJ Satoshi Tomiie. Jack revealed this on Tumblr in March 2011.

Bitcoin Miner
Jack's college mascot at University of Missouri-Rolla was the Miners.

Adam Back, the first person that Satoshi emailed
Jack wore an Adam Back code t-shirt in his college yearbook photo and linked to Back's website in the 90s from his own with the note "Very good."

Hal Finney, the first person to really help Satoshi
Jack linked to Hal's website in the 90s from his own with the note "essays, explanations, and challenges".

Ecash (What Satoshi originally called Bitcoin)
Jack linked to David Chaum's Digicash (ecash) website and to a page that contained Cypherpunks' C library-based ecash-lucre in the 90s. Jack noted this page as being "The best."

Cryptography
Jack is confirmed to have been obsessed with cryptography, dedicating his personal website to it in the 90s

Cypherpunks
Jack confirmed to be one of ~1,300 subscribed cypherpunks in the world in 1996, and made the list a central focus of his website while promoting its mission. Another one of his emails is confirmed to have been on the list in 2000. 

Bitcoin White Paper
The White Paper cited a 1997 ACM Research paper and Jack was a confirmed member of ACM in 1997. 

Research Paper Production
Jack ran a team of programmers in the 90s at Mira Digital Publishing that wrote academic research paper production and distribution software. Such papers were formatted like the Bitcoin White Paper.

St. Louis
In 2014, a hacker tried to extort Satoshi after breaking into his email by publishing a doctored Invoice with a St. Louis address. Jack is from St. Louis.

Windows (what Satoshi first coded Bitcoin for)
Jack is confirmed to have coded for Windows, Mac, BSD, Linux, and Blackberry all prior to Bitcoin's release.

Numerology
11/19 - Satoshi joined the Bitcoin forum on 11/19 (Jack's birthday)
1/11 - Satoshi's first transaction to Hal Finney was 1/11 (Jack's mom's birthday)

California
Satoshi's IP is widely believed to have leaked on 1/10/09, placing him in California. Jack was in California at the time.

Sailor's Adage
The bitcoin source code contained the phrase  "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three." Jack was obsessed with sailing.

"Denials"
2020 - Jack tells Lex Fridman that if he was Satoshi he wouldn't tell him. 
2023 - Jack tells a conference interviewer in an odd  denial that "Bitcoin and Satoshi in 2009 was a combination of my childhood and my curiosity and everything that I aspired to be and everything I loved."

British Spellings
Satoshi occasionally used British spellings, but not all the time. Jack in 2009 shared that he sometimes changes the language settings in his phone. So UK English settings would have therefore auto-corrected his American English to British.

Craig Wright
The COPA lawsuit that disproved Wright as Satoshi was financed primarily by Jack.

Jak
Wright claimed to own thousands of Bitcoin addresses in a lawsuit but this was thrown into doubt in 2020 when 145 of them signed a message claiming Wright was a fraud. The oldest address, from May 2009, was 1JaKriNjceGmggKYQkURmatQv6LXyvUiAB.  "Jak" was how Jack spelled his name for about 7 years and was also his online pseudonym. Satoshi had previously written about brute forcing the first few characters of a Bitcoin address to spell out one's name.

Novels
Jack's friend Alyssa Milano wrote 2 books (Hacktivist 1 and 2) about Jack, that claimed that he had been living a double life under a famous hacking pseudonym. The first was written in 2013. Jack is godfather to her child.

First
Jack's company Square was the first publicly traded company to talk to the SEC about Bitcoin.
Jack's company Square was the first publicly traded company to sell Bitcoin.

Web-based Payments
Jack's company Dnet first contemplated web-based payments without a bank account starting in 1998. Jack's company Square revolutionized retail POS payments (founded in 2009).

Self-control
Jack is already a twice self-made and publicly famous billionaire. Satoshi's "wealth" of Bitcoins would hardly be enticing, especially given his philanthropic attitude and behavior.

Reasons to hide in the beginning
In July 2008,  E-Gold Ltd. (E-Gold), an Internet-based digital currency business, and its three principal directors and owners, pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to money laundering and the operation of an illegal money transmitting business. 

Reasons to keep hiding in 2010-2011
Twitter was in the hot seat with the US government over WikiLeaks' usage of twitter to distribute information.
Twitter's board was planning to bring Jack back into a day-to-day role.
People were using Bitcoin to fund WikiLeaks.

Visa was planning to invest in Jack's company Square.
Visa had banned payments to WikiLeaks.
Visa announced its investment in Jack's company a couple days after Satoshi announced his goodbye.

Wei Dai, Nick Szabo
Adam Back testified in the COPA lawsuit that he did not think Satoshi was familiar with Wei Dai's "b-money" because he had to tell him about it. Meanwhile, the cypherpunks had to tell Satoshi about Nick Szabo's "Bit Gold." Jack's cypherpunk fan page mentions several cypherpunks including Adam Back and Hal Finney, as mentioned before, but did not mention Wei Dai or Nick Szabo, as if he perhaps he wasn't aware of them either, just like Satoshi.

Open Source Track Record
Jack's commitment to open-source software is well established and can be traced going back to the mid-90s. From Dnet to apps he wrote, to statements he made, to forums he posted on.
